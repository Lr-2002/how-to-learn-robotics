**[RVBUST INC.](http://www.rvbust.com)** has established for more than half a  year(till 2019). After interviewing many parters from robotics research, I've found a big question that almost students do not graduated from Robotics Engeering.

Absolutely, most of them graduated from different majors such as EE or CS. Or someone may have research experience in robotics lab or company, They should be counted in "Professional".

However, it seems that these guys do not have complete knowledge of Robotics.People drawing the PCB don't know about analysis of Robotics Work Space; Guys who design mechnisms have no idea how to apply kinematics to control; And control boys don't know what is Configuration Space;People designing path planning have never accessed to Q-learning.While guys doing DRL don't know how to use CLI to move your robot.

It's understandable for me from my learning experience.I got The SmartPal Robot from my senior when i was just a Phd. Reling on the 'Old Code' from his, i pretended to show for foreign guests.


However when i reviewed these codes, i found out threre was just a few joint coordinates sent to the robots.
>Where is your PID control?

That was my biggest question at that time. The code was entirely different from the smart-car or drone i've realied before!

So i turn to my seniors and classmates but end with no answers. I didn't get the answer when i have learned many robotics-relative class in my graduate age.

My school was one of the college establishing Robotics Research in China, However, we were just educated how to build D-H coordinate and how to sovle three-links' dynamics problem. While the important problems such as how to solve control, how to do path-planning or even dynamics inverse were not required.

For all I know, it's almost same in other institution in China.Established education system has not been formed here. It's hard to find a student with complete robotics education who have graduated from China's college, what they have is just the ability they need in their project.As a result, many guys have not solve robotics inverse but graduate with high degree.

I'm not saying it's hard to take over knowledge like 'Kinematics Inverse' or 'interpolation for path'.I want to emphasize that students could not grasp or even attach to such basic knowledge by listen to teacher's class.

This phenomenon is just popular in China Mainland, while for students graduated from college out CM ,they have more comprehensive understanding in robotics for their homework could cover many important points.

Though my guys are mostly not graduated from Robotics Subject, They are very clever to grasp these knowledge by themselves with some guidance . So let's get start to learn robotics as an untutored robotics-man.

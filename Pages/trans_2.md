Prerequests are absolutely changing with you going deep into research, especially matmatics. Math is just like Sharingan for Uzumaki Naruto.You could see different things with different level Sharingan when look at the same stela.

Basic math including plus, minus, multi and division enable you to be a Robotics Debuging 
 Engneer ; Linear Algebra, Calculus could help to grasp Kinematics, Dynamics and Modeling Method.Then you could take part in perception, planning and learning works after you've learned calculation method, convex optimization and differential geometry.

However, you'll be limited if you are trapped in the pre-requests knowledge at start because robotics is a interdisciplanry course with different basic knowledge.

So, just getting some basic knowledge and learning others later will be more sensible.

1. Basic English(my be easy for you English Speaker): There is almost no suitable Chinese textbook to recommend(Things changed nowawadays, you could turn for China Machine Press or other press.)The best textbooks are almost foreign books.So we have to learn with English book.It's terrible for us but the ending worth it. Even you could be suitable to it after one month.
2. Learn how to use VPN. The reason is same as former opinion.Useful resources are supplied by Youtube or Google.
3. Linear Algebra. All of saptial alternation and calculation of robotics rely on it and the mind of linear space.I recommend Prof. Gilbert Strang's *Linear Algebra* for you . You could see the courese on Youtube or Wangyi. It help you to consider problems from space ranther than how to calculate det or matrix. What's more, there is Chinese subtitle on Wangyi which is okey for us.
4. Calculus: Calculus coule be seen everywhere once it relates to differential, integral or optimization.So this is the most basic cource you need to cover. There is no recommend course, how about try Gillber Strang's *Highlights of Calculus*?
5. Theoretical mechanics. Robotics takes mechanics as his wife, but there is no books tell you how to infer spatial alternation, virtual work and Lagrange mechanics theory.What's worse is that they are almost abstract stopping beginner from the beautiful Robotics world.You could try Gao Yunfeng's *Theoretical mechanics* to learn it.
6. Matlab or Python. They are all easy to get on hand and easy to visualize your data. You could realize some algorithms with these scripts without difficulties to verify your answer.You could just use them for matrix opretion and viz at start. And get deep-in methods in future if you are interested . What's more, turn to Coursera to find classes .
7. Control Theory. You could not make a robot without control system while it's not common in robotics textbook.It's true that almost industrial robotics are now using simple algorithm, but you need to grasp some basic control system like PID, State equation, Lyapunov ,optimum control and so on.Go to Youtube for Brian Doublas's video.

8. Digit circuit and Artificial circuit.Robotics is a partical discipline, once you've make your inference be code and move your real robots, you've mastered the knowledge. A/D could help you know about logic circuit so as to avoiding why there is a dirver before motor.At the same time, using a small circuit to test control system seems helpful without real robotics besides.You could go for these knowledge easily on the internet.
9. A little of SCM.It's not enough to build a circuit only with A/D knowledge.So learn some knowledge of SCM to convert A/D model to circuit and use code to control and realize A/D.For this part, just try some common SCM with server system like Ardunio or STM32, taking part in RoboMaster or Freescale Cup for smart cars will enable to understand different parts for Embedded system.
10. Linux and C. Linux and C is the code and os you will need to convert physics formula to command.C coding is an important part and you just need to know the basic grammar, like this book. What's more try Linux to understand C in more deep layers.Besides, Linux is very helpful for  you know about OS.
11. Basic 3D design.3D design is very useful when you are constructing a experiment system.It could accelerate the development speed with the manufacture of little compents. I recommend SolidWorks to learn. And then use 3D printer to print it or turn to the help of internet, send your STL model to some print server and just wait.


Alright, these knowledge will be all taught for you if you are elder than three grades in Automation or Machine major.Then let's start the robotics journey.
